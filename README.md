# minimal-RTE__tei-xml
Minimal customization of Quill.js Rich Text Editor for easy annotation of text snippets with a small range of TEI-XML elements and attributes.

## Sample data

The sample data contained in `data/example.json` is taken from the first four epigraphic records of the catalogue [Frankfurt a.M., Battonstraße](http://www.steinheim-institut.de/cgi-bin/epidat?id=ffb), available on [_EPIDAT ─ Research Platform for Jewish Epigraphy_](http://www.steinheim-institut.de/cgi-bin/epidat?lang=en) built by [Thomas Kollatz](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1904-1841). The epigraphic records are published under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## ToDo

* Implement functionality worked out in minimal-RTE__ner-training-data
* Refactoring the code to be more concise.
* Easier customization for buttons.
